# Chapter 13: The Virtual Filesystem
The `Virtual Filesystem` (VFS) is the subsystem of the kernel that implements the file and filesystem-related interfaces to user-space. All filesystems rely on the VFS not only to coexist but also to interoperate. This enables programs to use standard Unix system calls to read and write to different filesystems, even on different media.

## Common Filesystem interfaces
The VFS enables system calls work between different filesystems and media. New filesystems and new Virtual of storage media can find their way into Linux, and programs need not be rewritten or even recompiled.


## Filesystem Abstraction
Ther kernel implements an abstraction layer around its low-level filesystem interface. This abstraction layer works by defining the basic conceptual interfaces and data structures that all filesystems support.


## Unix Filesystem
Unix has provided four basic filesystem-related abstractions:
- `file`: A `file` is an ordered string of bytes. The first byte marks the beginning of the file, and the last byte marks the end of the file. Each file is assigned a human-readable name for identification by both the system and the user.
- `directory entries`: Files are organized in directories. A `directory` is analogous to a folder and usually contrains related files. Directories can also contain other directories, called subdirectories. In this fashion, directories may be nested to form paths. Each component of a path is called a `directory entry`, all of them called `dentries`. A directory is a file to the VFS.
- `inodes`: Information about a file called `file metadata` and is stored in a separate data structure form the file, called the `inode`.
- `mount points`: filesystems are mounted at a specific mount point in a global hierarchy known as a `namespace`. This enables all mounted filesystems to appear as entries in a single tree.


## VFS Objects and Their Data Structures
The VFS is object-oriented. A family of data structures represents the common file model. These data structures are skin to objects.

The four primary object types of the VFS are:
- The `superblock` object, which represents a specific mounted filesystem.
- The `inode` object, which represents a specific file.
- The `dentry` object, which represents a directory entry, which is a single component of a path.
- The `file` object, which represents an open file are associated with a process.

An `operations` object is contained within each of these primary objects. These objects describe the methods that the kernel invokes agains the primary objects:
- The `super_operations` object, which contains the methods that the kernel can invoke on a specific filesystem, such as `write_inode()` and `sync_fs()`.
- The `inode_operations` object, which contains the methods that the kernel can invoke on a specific file, such as `create()` and `link()`.
- The `dentry_operations` object, which contains the methods that the kernel can invoke on a specific directory entry, such as `d_compare()` and `d_delete()`.
- The `file_operations` object, which contains the methods that a process can invoke on an open file, such as `read()` and `write()`.

The operations objects are implemented as a structure of pointers to functions that operate on the parent object.


## The Superblock Object
The superblock object is implemented by each filesystem and is used to store information describing that specific filesystem. This object usually corresponds to the filesystem superblock or the filesystem control block, which is stored in a special sector on disk. Filesystems that are not disk-based generate the superblock on-the-fly and store it in memory.

The superblock object is represented by `struct super_block` and defined in `<linux/fs.h>`:
```
struct super_block {
        struct list_head          s_list;             /* list of all superblocks */
        dev_t                     s_dev;              /* identifier */
        unsigned long             s_blocksize;        /* block size in bytes */
        unsigned char             s_blocksize_bits;   /* block size in bits */
        unsigned char             s_dirt;             /* dirty flag */
        unsigned long long        s_maxbytes;         /* max file size */

        struct dentry             *s_root;            /* directory mount point */
        struct rw_semaphore       s_umount;           /* unmount semaphore */
        struct semaphore          s_lock;             /* superblock semaphore */
        int                       s_count;            /* superblock ref count */

        struct list_head          s_inodes;           /* list of inodes */
        struct list_head          s_dirty;            /* list of dirty inodes */
        struct list_head          s_io;               /* list of writebacks */

        struct list_head          s_dentry_lru;       /* list of unused dentries */
        int                       s_nr_dentry_unused; /* number of dentries on list */
        struct block_device       *s_bdev;            /* associated block device */
        struct mtd_info           *s_mtd;             /* memory disk information */
        struct list_head          s_instances;        /* instances of this fs */
        struct quota_info         s_dquot;            /* quota-specific options */
        int                       s_frozen;           /* frozen status */
        wait_queue_head_t         s_wait_unfrozen;    /* wait queue on freeze */
        char                      s_id[32];           /* text name */
        void                      *s_fs_info;         /* filesystem-specific info */
        fmode_t                   s_mode;             /* mount permissions */
        struct semaphore          s_vfs_rename_sem;   /* rename semaphore */
        u32                       s_time_gran;        /* granularity of timestamps */
        char                      *s_subtype;         /* subtype name */
        char                      *s_options;         /* saved mount options */
};
```

The code for creating, managing, and destroying superblock objects lives in `fs/super.c`. A superblock object is created and initialized via the `alloc_super()` function. When mounted, a filesystem invokes this function, reads its superblock off of the disk, and fills in its superblock object.


## Superblock Operations
The most important item in the superblock object is `s_op`, which is a pointer to the superblock operations table. The superblock operations table is represented by `struct super_operations` and is defined in `<linux/fs.h>`, which looks like this:
```
struct super_operations {
        struct inode *(*alloc_inode)(struct super_block *sb);
        void (*destroy_inode)(struct inode *);
        void (*dirty_inode) (struct inode *);
        int (*write_inode) (struct inode *, int);
        void (*drop_inode) (struct inode *);
        void (*delete_inode) (struct inode *);
        void (*put_super) (struct super_block *);
        void (*write_super) (struct super_block *);
        int (*sync_fs)(struct super_block *sb, int wait);
        int (*freeze_fs) (struct super_block *);
        int (*unfreeze_fs) (struct super_block *);
        int (*statfs) (struct dentry *, struct kstatfs *);
        int (*remount_fs) (struct super_block *, int *, char *);
        void (*clear_inode) (struct inode *);
        void (*umount_begin) (struct super_block *);
        int (*show_options)(struct seq_file *, struct vfsmount *);
        int (*show_stats)(struct seq_file *, struct vfsmount *);
        ssize_t (*quota_read)(struct super_block *, int, char *, size_t, loff_t);
        ssize_t (*quota_write)(struct super_block *, int, const char *, size_t, loff_t);
        int (*bdev_try_to_free_page)(struct super_block*, struct page*, gfp_t);
};
```
Each item in this structure is a pointer to a function that operates on a superblock object. The superblock operations perform low-level operations on the filesystem and its inodes.

When a filesystem needs to perform an operation on its superblock, it follows the pointers from its superblock object to the desired method. For example:
```
sb->s_op->write_super(sb);
```

The following are some of the superblock operations that are specified by `super_operations`:

- `struct inode * alloc_inode(struct super_block *sb)`
    - Creates and initializes a new inode object under the given superblock.
- `void destroy_inode(struct inode *inode)`
    - Deallocates the given inode.
- `void dirty_inode(struct inode *inode)`
    - Invoked by the VFS when an inode is dirtied (modified). Journaling filesystems such as ext3 and ext4 use this function to perform journal updates.
- `void write_inode(struct inode *inode, int wait)`
    - Writes the given inode to disk. The `wait` parameter specifies whether the operation should be synchronous.
- `void drop_inode(struct inode *inode)`
    - Called by the VFS when the last reference to an inode is dropped. Normal Unix filesystems do not define this function, in which case the VFS simply deletes the inode.
- `void delete_inode(struct inode *inode)`
    - Deletes the given inode from the disk.
- `void put_super(struct super_block *sb)`
    - Called by the VFS on unmount to release the given superblock object.The caller must hold the `s_lock` lock.
- `void write_super(struct super_block *sb)`
    - Updates the on-disk superblock with the specified superblock.The VFS uses this function to synchronize a modified in-memory superblock with the disk. The caller must hold the `s_lock` lock.
- `int sync_fs(struct super_block *sb, int wait)`
    - Synchronizes filesystem metadata with the on-disk filesystem. The `wait` parameter specifies whether the operation is synchronous.
- `void write_super_lockfs(struct super_block *sb)`
    - Prevents changes to the filesystem, and then updates the on-disk superblock with the specified superblock. It is currently used by LVM (the Logical Volume Manager).
- `void unlockfs(struct super_block *sb)`
    - Unlocks the filesystem against changes as done by `write_super_lockfs()`.
- `int statfs(struct super_block *sb, struct statfs *statfs)`
    - Called by the VFS to obtain filesystem statistics. The statistics related to the given filesystem are placed in `statfs`.
- `int remount_fs(struct super_block *sb, int *flags, char *data)`
    - Called by the VFS when the filesystem is remounted with new mount options.The caller must hold the `s_lock` lock.
- `void clear_inode(struct inode *inode)`
    - Called by the VFS to release the inode and clear any pages containing related data.
- `void umount_begin(struct super_block *sb)`
    - Called by the VFS to interrupt a mount operation. It is used by network filesystems, such as NFS.
