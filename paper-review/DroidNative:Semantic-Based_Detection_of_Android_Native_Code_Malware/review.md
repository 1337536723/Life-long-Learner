[Alam S, Qu Z, Riley R, et al. DroidNative: Semantic-Based Detection of Android Native Code Malware[J]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1602.04693, 2016.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04693)

## What are motivations for this work?
### native code
A recent study shows that 86% of the most popular Android applications contain native code.

### current methods
the plethora of more sophisticated detectors making use of static analysis techniques to detect such variants operate only at the bytecode level, meaning that malware embedded in native code goes undetected.

- No coverage of Android native binary code.
- Do not handle obfuscations at function level. Low level semantics are not covered.
- Heuristics used are very specific to malware programs, and hence are not scalable.
- Slow runtimes, can not be used in a practical system.

## What is the proposed solution?
>This paper introduces DroidNative, a malware detection system for Android that operates at the native code level and is able to detect malware in either bytecode or native code. DroidNative performs static analysis of the native code and focuses on patterns in the control flow that are not significantly impacted by obfuscations. DroidNative is not limited to only analyzing native code, it is also able to analyze bytecode by making use of the Android runtime (ART) to compile bytecode into native code suitable for analysis. The use of control flow with patterns enables DroidNative to detect smaller size malware, which allows DroidNative to reduce the size of a signature for optimizing the detection time without reducing the DR.

## What are the contributons?
- DroidNative is the first system that builds and designs cross-platform signatures for Android and operates at the native code level, allowing it to detect malware embedded in either bytecode or native code.
- DroidNative is faster than existing systems, making it suitable for real-time analysis.
